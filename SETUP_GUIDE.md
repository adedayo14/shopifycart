## �🎁 Free Gift Setup - IMPROVED

### Real-Time Gift Handling
- **Problem**: Required save click, added to cart total
- **Solution**: Immediate gift addition/removal with total exclusion
- **Result**: Gifts work instantly without affecting cart total

### Method 1: Create a $0 Gift Product (Recommended)
1. **Create a new product** in Shopify admin specifically for gifts
2. **Set the price to $0.00**
3. **Give it a clear name** like "Free Gift - Sample Pack"
4. **Use this product** in the extension's Gift Product picker

### Method 2: Use Automatic Discounts
1. **Go to Shopify Admin** > Discounts
2. **Create "Automatic discount"**
3. **Choose "Buy X Get Y"** or "Amount off products"
4. **Set conditions:**
   - Minimum purchase amount (matches your gift threshold)
   - Target your gift product specifically
5. **Set discount to 100%** to make it free

### Gift Logic Improvements
- **Instant Addition**: Gifts added immediately when threshold reached
- **Instant Removal**: Gifts removed if cart value drops
- **Total Exclusion**: Gift prices excluded from progress calculations
- **Smart Handling**: Detects existing gifts to prevent duplicates
